## HOW TO RUN##
if you are running the client and server on the same machine
    run the server first then run the client(s) at the same time.

else:
   change the 'server_name' variable to the network name of the device you are running the server on
NOTE: you can only connect to devices that are connected to your local network(e.g. etheret) or router/modem


##Bugs
Doesnt run asynchronously on different machines
very rare bug that doesn't send messages
